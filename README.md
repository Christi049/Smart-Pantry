## ðŸ§  Model & Adapter
- **Base Model:** [`unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct-bnb-4bit)  
- **LoRA Adapter:** [`Christi049/meal-gen-adapter`](https://huggingface.co/Christi049/meal-gen-adapter)  

The adapter is loaded dynamically from Hugging Face, keeping this repo lightweight.

## âš¡ Usage
This project requires GPU memory and a compatible runtime (Colab or LM Studio) to run the model. Cloning the repo alone will not allow local CPU-only execution.
Recommended Setup:
1. Open the Colab notebook:
   [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18AObSFJ3AQw-h-yIIqBIhuseXsbSKApp?usp=sharing)
2. Upload the dataset(download from repo) file when prompted. 
3. Scroll to the bottom of the notebook where the input cell is provided. Modify the input JSON as needed to reflect your serving size, dietary restrictions, allergens, and ingredients.
4. Run the input cell to generate your 7-day meal plan, prioritizing ingredients that will expire soon. The output includes both:
  display_text for human-readable meals
  description_for_model used internally by the model
